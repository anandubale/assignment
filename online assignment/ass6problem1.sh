#1Write a program that takes a command-line argument n and prints a table of the powers of 2 that are less than or equal to 2^n.

#2. Write a program that takes a command-line argument n and prints the nth harmonic number. Harmonic Number is of the form


























#3. Write a program that takes a input and determines if the number is a prime.


echo "Enter the number"
read num

#4. Extend the program to take a range of number as input and output the Prime Numbers in that range.




























#5. Write a program that computes a factorial of a number taken as input. Factorial â€“ 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5

echo "Enter the number"
read num
fact=1
for (( counter=1; counter<=num; counter++ ))
do
	fact=$(( $fact * $counter))
	echo $fact	

done
echo "EOP5"



#6. Write a program to compute Factors of a number N using prime factorization method.

#Logic -> Traverse till i*i <= N instead of i <= N for efficiency.
#O/P -> Print the prime factors of number N.
